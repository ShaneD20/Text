# Text a C-String Wrapper

## Note
Text is currently not designed for performance critical code 
and there are not any plans to make this a performant library at this time.

## About
Text is a very lightweight library for managing c strings in an easier manor.
Meant to be compatible with most versions of C++.

## Use Cases
- Any project that is dependant on c strings
- Project where refactoring away from c strings would be cumbersome.
